        <h1>Getting Started with Flare and GitHub</h1>
        <p>If you think you want to pursue this option, go ahead and pull up the related emails that I sent to the class yesterday and today. I've also added some relevant links to the course schedule (under this week's meeting dates): https://engl381spring2016.wordpress.com/.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>1. <b>Create a GitHub Account</b>. This is simple -- you'll need to give them a username and an email address. You will need to confirm the account via email, so do use an actual email account that you can access. Also: the free GitHub accounts require you to make your content (the files you're creating in Flare) public. This isn't a big deal, but just keep that in mind when choosing your username, etc.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>2. <b>Create a GitHub Repository using your account</b>: https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/. You will need to come up with a short name for your repository -- I chose <b>381-flare</b>, for example.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>3. <b>Bind Flare to GitHub</b>. Once you've set up your GitHub Account, you can go into Flare and "Bind" it. Follow these instructions: http://webhelp.madcapsoftware.com/flare11/Content/Source_Control/Git/Binding_an_Existing_Project_to_Source_Control_git.htm.</p>
